## Flutter Shop App

<br/>
<br/>

In this app, I created three screens-
<br/>

- ProductsList Screen
- Favorites Screen
- Cart Screen
  I used provider package for state management and everything is very similiar to myntra app.
  <br/>

![Alt text](assets/imgs/pl1.jpeg 'products list')
<br/>
![Alt text](assets/imgs/pl2.jpeg 'mark favorites products list')
<br/>

![Alt text](assets/imgs/wl.jpeg 'wishlist')
<br/>

![Alt text](assets/imgs/c1.jpeg 'cart')
<br/>

![Alt text](assets/imgs/c2.jpeg 'cart popup')
<br/>
